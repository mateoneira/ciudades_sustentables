Data was collected by Qi Wang and John E. Taylor using the open API provided by Twitter.

Each .csv file provides the geographical coordinates from all the individual users involved in this study. The five columns are natural disaster event, anonymous user ID, latitude, longitude, time. To protect the privacy of these Twitter users, the longitudes of the geographical coordinates were modified so the locations are shown in a different area. We conducted additional analyses and confirmed that the results calculated by the Haversine formula based on the modified data had no difference from the ones based on the original data.
